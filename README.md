# Esp-Now_Smart
Esp-Now is a great and easy to work with communcation system between two or more wifi enabled esp32s, but it lackes features and fuctions, that is where Esp-Now_Smart comes in and adds upon the existing frame work for the better!

Goal: using the existing ESp-Now protocol and building upon it for a smart room/home impleamintations, but without using esp home or other kind of networks where u need a server and wifi connection. It will work by a mesh network of different sensors and esp32's. Esp32 most used will be from the seeedstudios xiao and emed series because of the small formfactors. (esp32 xiao c3 and nrf52480 sense).

I am hoping to implemed the flowing fuctions:
- Repeaters for packet retransmittion.
- Main controller 'server controller'.
- Support for multiplul sensors (sensor list).


Sensor list:
